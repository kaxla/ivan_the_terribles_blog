# Ivan The Terrible's Blog 2.0
### Now with 100% less being slow

This blog's load time started out here (in development mode):

and is now here (in development mode):

![after-dev](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/257144768/terrible%20blog%20after.png)

and here in production on Heroku:

To do this I added pagination and nested comments/replies under posts so that you could click through to see them instead of displaying on the front page.
